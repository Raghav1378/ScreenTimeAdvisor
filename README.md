# ScreenTimeAdvisor

## Overview
ScreenTimeAdvisor is an AI-powered tool designed to predict whether a child's daily screen time exceeds recommended limits. By analyzing behavioral patterns, device usage, and health-related features, this application helps parents, educators, and caregivers identify excessive screen usage and promote balanced digital habits.

## Features
- Predicts if a child's screen time exceeds recommended limits (0 = within limit, 1 = exceeds limit).
- Covers multiple factors including age, device type, educational vs. recreational screen time, and health impacts such as eye strain, poor sleep, anxiety, and obesity risk.
- Performs comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations.
- Trains and evaluates multiple machine learning models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
  - AdaBoost
  - Bagging
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - XGBoost
- Ensemble models included:
  - Voting Classifier
  - Stacking Classifier
- Streamlit-based interactive web app for real-time predictions.

## Repository Contents
- `ScreenTimeAdvisor.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with EDA, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `dataset.csv` – Dataset used for training and testing the models.
- `app.py` – Streamlit web application for interactive predictions.
- Pre-trained models (`*.pkl`) – Saved ML models for direct usage in the app.
